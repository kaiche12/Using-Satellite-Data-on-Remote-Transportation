Using Satellite Data on Remote Transportation

This repository is for the following pre-print paper

https://www.techrxiv.org/articles/preprint/Using_Satellite_Data_on_Remote_Transportation_of_Air_Pollutants_for_PM2_5_Prediction_in_Northern_Taiwan/13734067

We have include codes that performed prediction for next 4hour. The same codes are used from predicting of the remaining hours but same changes needed to the data shape only.

Majority of the dataset we used are very large for example train size for each satellite tile is 11.7GB, remote weather train size is 1.1GB and for testing each tile has a size of 5.9GB. Therefore we were not able to include those file in our repository.

The satellite dataset can be found in this link https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/search/order/3/MCD19A2--6
